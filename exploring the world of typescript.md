__Exploring the world of typescript (feat. React, eslint)__

Typescript is no doubt an amazing tool, and with it, things can easily get out of hand when you are starting out. Here are the things you should know about typescript in relation to react, node, tools, testing etc.

SN: start by exploring the defaults in the linting of typescript. Next explore the library used for linting, and with the common library that we use, eg jest, node, etc. And lastly explore typescript with react, typescript with react libraries, 

__The aim__

Have sufficient knowledge of using typescript, react, and the tooling surrounding them. The goal is to understand this deeply. To mitigate error, ensure a smooth workflow, and avoid the frustration the comes with replacing typescript with javascript.

__Installation__

1. Install typescript itself
2. Install definition
3. Install the tools and dependency i.e eslint, eslint-typescript, ts-jest, ts-node... Notice that the tools and library should now be compatible with typescript and this can get overwhelming. The natural way of coding javascript has now be altered. 
4. Library compartible and not compartible with typescript

__The errors__
1. javascript errors
2. typescript errors
3. linting errors
4. library compartibility error / typescript error

__Typing examples__
